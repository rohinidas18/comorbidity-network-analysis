233	YPEL4	9606.ENSP00000432648	YPEL4	Protein yippee-like 4; Yippee like family; Belongs to the yippee family
234	SYNJ2	9606.ENSP00000347792	SYNJ2	Synaptojanin-2; Inositol 5-phosphatase which may be involved in distinct membrane trafficking and signal transduction pathways. May mediate the inhibitory effect of Rac1 on endocytosis; Belongs to the synaptojanin family
235	GPRC5A	9606.ENSP00000014914	GPRC5A	G protein-coupled receptor family c group 5 member a; Retinoic acid-induced protein 3; Orphan receptor. Could be involved in modulating differentiation and maintaining homeostasis of epithelial cells. This retinoic acid-inducible GPCR provide evidence for a possible interaction between retinoid and G-protein signaling pathways. Functions as a negative modulator of EGFR signaling (By similarity). May act as a lung tumor suppressor
