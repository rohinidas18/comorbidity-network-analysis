304	PPARG	9606.ENSP00000287820	PPARG	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma; Nuclear receptor that binds peroxisome proliferators such as hypolipidemic drugs and fatty acids. Once activated by a ligand, the nuclear receptor binds to DNA specific PPAR response elements (PPRE) and modulates the transcription of its target genes, such as acyl-CoA oxidase. It therefore controls the peroxisomal beta-oxidation pathway of fatty acids. Key regulator of adipocyte differentiation and glucose homeostasis. ARF6 acts as a key regulator of the tissue-specific adipocyte P2 (aP2) enhancer. Acts as a critical regulator of gut ho [...] 
305	TPM3	9606.ENSP00000357516	TPM3	Tropomyosin alpha-3 chain; Binds to actin filaments in muscle and non-muscle cells. Plays a central role, in association with the troponin complex, in the calcium dependent regulation of vertebrate striated muscle contraction. Smooth muscle contraction is regulated by interaction with caldesmon. In non-muscle cells is implicated in stabilizing cytoskeleton actin filaments; Belongs to the tropomyosin family
306	RPL15	9606.ENSP00000309334	RPL15	Large subunit ribosomal protein l15e; Ribosomal protein L15
307	AIF1	9606.ENSP00000365227	AIF1	Allograft inflammatory factor 1; Actin-binding protein that enhances membrane ruffling and RAC activation. Enhances the actin-bundling activity of LCP1. Binds calcium. Plays a role in RAC signaling and in phagocytosis. May play a role in macrophage activation and function. Promotes the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and of T- lymphocytes. Enhances lymphocyte migration. Plays a role in vascular inflammation; EF-hand domain containing
308	YPEL4	9606.ENSP00000432648	YPEL4	Protein yippee-like 4; Yippee like family; Belongs to the yippee family
309	SYNJ2	9606.ENSP00000347792	SYNJ2	Synaptojanin-2; Inositol 5-phosphatase which may be involved in distinct membrane trafficking and signal transduction pathways. May mediate the inhibitory effect of Rac1 on endocytosis; Belongs to the synaptojanin family
310	GPRC5A	9606.ENSP00000014914	GPRC5A	G protein-coupled receptor family c group 5 member a; Retinoic acid-induced protein 3; Orphan receptor. Could be involved in modulating differentiation and maintaining homeostasis of epithelial cells. This retinoic acid-inducible GPCR provide evidence for a possible interaction between retinoid and G-protein signaling pathways. Functions as a negative modulator of EGFR signaling (By similarity). May act as a lung tumor suppressor
